# Anti Sleep Alarm for Drivers

## Overview
Driver fatigue and drowsiness are major contributors to road accidents globally. This project presents an IoT-based anti-sleep alarm system designed to enhance road safety by detecting signs of driver drowsiness and alerting them in real-time.

The system uses an **Arduino Nano** microcontroller and an **eye blink sensor** to monitor the driver's eye movements. Upon detecting prolonged eye closures or drowsiness patterns, it activates a **piezo buzzer** to alert the driver.

## Features
- Real-time drowsiness detection using an eye blink sensor.
- Immediate audio alert using a piezo buzzer to regain driver attention.
- Portable and cost-effective design with easy integration into vehicles.
- Supports additional motion-based responses using a gear motor and wheel.

## Components Used
- Arduino Nano
- Eye blink sensor
- Piezo buzzer
- Relay module
- Gear motor and wheel
- 9V battery
- SPST switch
- Connecting wires

## Installation and Usage

### 1. Circuit Setup
- Connect the components as per the circuit design:
  - Eye blink sensor to monitor drowsiness.
  - Relay to control the buzzer.
  - Arduino Nano for data processing and control.

### 2. Power Supply
- Use a 9V battery to power the Arduino Nano and connected components.

### 3. Testing
- Ensure the eye blink sensor detects eye closures and triggers the buzzer.
- Verify that the system activates as expected upon detecting drowsiness.

### 4. Integration
- Mount the system in a secure and accessible location in your vehicle.
- Calibrate the sensitivity of the eye blink sensor for optimal performance.
